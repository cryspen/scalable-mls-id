2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Expandable Tree

   An expandable tree is a modified ratchet tree as described in
   [mls-protocol].  An expandable tree stores only the direct path from
   the member to the root plus additional information about the co-path.

   In particular, a list of Hashes are stored for the member's co-path,
   containing the node's index, it's tree hash as computed on the full
   tree, and the original tree hash as computed on the full tree (recall
   that the original tree hash is the node's tree hash excluding any
   unmerged leaves).

   struct {
     uint32 index;
     opaque tree_hash<V>;
     opaque original_tree_hash<V>;
   } Hashes;

   TODO: Add tree pictures examples for explanation

3.1.  Verifying Tree Validity

   A client that has an expandable tree can not do all the checks that a
   client with the full tree can do.  We therefore update the checks
   performed on tree modifications.  In particular the validation of
   commits and welcome packages are modified compared to [mls-protocol].

3.1.1.  Commit

   When a new member joins the group with a Welcome message
   (Section 12.4.3.1. [mls-protocol]) without the ratchet tree extension
   the checks are updated as follows.

   1.  Verify the sender's membership (see Section 3.2).

   2.  Check the own direct path to the root.

   3.  Do _not_ verify leaves in the tree.

3.2.  Proof of Membership

   To verify the group membership of the sender of a commit, the
   receiver with an expandable tree checks the sender's leaf signature
   as well as the correctness of the tree as described in Section 3.3.

3.3.  Verify Expandable Tree

   To verify the correctness of an expandable tree the client checks its
   tree hash and parent hashes.  For each direct path from a leaf to the
   root that the client has, it checks the parent hash value on each
   node by using original_tree_hash of the co-path nodes.  The tree hash
   on the root node is computed similarly, using the tree_hash values
   for all nodes where the client does not have the full nodes.

4.  Expandable Tree Extension

   The ExpandableTree is provided by the delivery service to the client
   on request.  Alternatively, a client can send the ExpandableTree as
   extension in Commit and Welcome messages.

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     xnode(1),
     hashes(2),
     (255)
   } XNodeType;

   struct {
     uint32: index;
     optional<Node> node;
   } XNode;

   struct {
     XNodeType node_type;
     select (XNode.node_typ) {
       case xnode:  XNode xnode;
       case hashes: Hashes hashes;
     }
   } ExpandableNode;

   struct {
     ExpandableNode nodes<V>;
     uint32 num_nodes;
   } ExpandableTree;
