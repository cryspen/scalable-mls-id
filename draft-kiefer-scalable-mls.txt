2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Expandable Tree

   An expandable tree is a modified ratchet tree as described in
   [mls-protocol].  An expandable tree stores only the direct path from
   the member to the root plus additional information about the co-path.

   In particular, a list of Hashes are stored for the member's co-path,
   containing the node's index, it's tree hash as computed on the full
   tree, and the original tree hash as computed on the full tree (recall
   that the original tree hash is the node's tree hash excluding any
   unmerged leaves).

   struct {
     uint32 index;
     opaque tree_hash<V>;
     opaque original_tree_hash<V>;
   } Hashes;

3.1.  Verifying Tree Validity

   A client that has an expandable tree can not do all the checks that a
   client with the full tree can do.  We therefore update the checks
   performed on tree modifications.  In particular the validation of
   commits and welcome packages are modified compared to [mls-protocol].

3.1.1.  Joining a Group with a Welcome

   When a new member joins the group with a Welcome message
   (Section 12.4.3.1. [mls-protocol]) without the ratchet tree extension
   the checks are updated as follows.

   1.  Verify the GroupInfo

       1.  signature

       2.  confirmation tag

       3.  tree hash

   2.  Verify the sender's membership (see Section 3.2).

   3.  Check the own direct path to the root (see Section 3.3).

   4.  Do _not_ verify leaves in the tree.

3.1.2.  Commit

   When a member receives a Commit message (Section 12.4.2.
   [mls-protocol]) the checks are updated as follows.

   1.  Verify the sender's membership (see Section 3.2).

   2.  If the own path changed, check it.

3.2.  Proof of Membership

   To verify the group membership of the sender of a commit, the
   receiver with an expandable tree checks the sender's leaf (see
   Section 7.3 [mls-protocol]), as well as the correctness of the tree
   as described in Section 3.3.

3.3.  Verify Expandable Tree

   To verify the correctness of an expandable tree the client checks its
   tree hash and parent hashes.  For each direct path from a leaf to the
   root that the client has, it checks the parent hash value on each
   node by using original_tree_hash of the co-path nodes.  The tree hash
   on the root node is computed similarly, using the tree_hash values
   for all nodes where the client does not have the full nodes.

   Check that the encryption keys of all received nodes are unique.

4.  Receiver specific Commits

   To reduce the size of Commit messages, especially in large, sparse
   trees, the delivery service can strip unnecessary parts of the Commit
   when using the public message type for MLSMessage.

   The structure of the message stays the same but the server removes
   all HPKECiphertext from the encrypted_path_secret in the commit's
   UpdatePath, if present, where the encryption_key does not match the
   receiver's encryption key.

   This breaks the signature on the FramedContent such that this MUST
   NOT be checked by the receiver of such a commit.

5.  Retrieving the Expandable Tree

   The ExpandableTree is provided by the delivery service to the client
   on request.  Alternatively, a client can send the ExpandableTree as
   extension in Commit and Welcome messages.  See Section 3 for details
   on the expandable tree extension.

5.1.  Expandable Tree from the Deliver Service

   In particular, when joining a group, after receiving a Welcome
   message, the client queries the delivery service for the expandable
   tree.  The delivery service must keep track of the group's state
   (tree) and assemble the ExpandableTree when requested for a given
   sender and receiver.

   When receiving a Commit message, the client queries the delivery
   service for the sender's direct path to check its membership.

5.2.  Expandable Tree from the Sender

   When the deliver service does not provide the necessary endpoints to
   query the expandable trees, the sender can include it into the
   GroupInfo extensions in the Welcome message.

   TODO: There no place to put extensions for Commits.

5.3.  Expandable Tree

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     xnode(1),
     hashes(2),
     (255)
   } XNodeType;

   struct {
     uint32: index;
     optional<Node> node;
   } XNode;

   struct {
     XNodeType node_type;
     select (XNode.node_typ) {
       case xnode:  XNode xnode;
       case hashes: Hashes hashes;
     }
   } ExpandableNode;

   struct {
     ExpandableNode nodes<V>;
     uint32 num_nodes;
   } ExpandableTree;

5.4.  Committing with an expandable Tree

   TODO: how to get from the expandable tree to the full tree

   *  check that full tree is consistent with expandable tree

   *  do all checks in Welcome

5.4.1.  Maintaining state

   TODO

   *  throw away state and stay in expandable trees

   *  keep the full tree and operate in full MLS after this point

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

   *  public keys only used when committing, at this point we have the
      full tree

   *  own path secrets

   *  proposal validation issues

      -  can't check double join

6.1.  Comparison with RFC MLS

   The main change compared to the protocol as specified in
   [mls-protocol] is that the receiver of a Welcome or Commit message,
   with an expandable tree, can not perform all checks as mandated in
   [mls-protocol].

   In particular the following checks are omitted.

   *  Check for uniqueness of all encryption and signature keys.
      Because not all keys are known, the check can only be performed on
      the known keys.

   *  Check validity of leaf nodes in the tree when joining a group.

   When using receiver specific commits the following checks are omitted
   in addition.

   *  Check the signature on the FramedContent.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
