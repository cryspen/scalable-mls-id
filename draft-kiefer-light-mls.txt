                      MLS with Lightweight Clients
                     draft-kiefer-light-mls-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a variant of the MLS protocol with
   lightweight clients that are passive in the protocol and only send
   application messages and proposals.

   Passive clients are advantageous on resource constrained devices or
   can be used to bootstrap clients lazily.  The reduced complexity,
   which also results in a smaller implementation, makes light clients
   attractive for many scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   This draft defines passive clients for MLS and required modifications
   on the infrastructure and full MLS clients.

   As such the document is structured as follows

   *  Section 3 gives an overview of the changes compared to [RFC9420]
      and introduces terminology and concepts used throughout this
      document.

   *  Section 4 defines data structures used for passive clients.

   *  Section 6 describes changes to [RFC9420] compliant MLS clients.

   *  Section 7 describes requirements on the delivery service and
      discusses deployment considerations.

   *  Section 8 details the operation of passive clients

   *  Section 9 discuss security implications for passive clients and
      deployments that involve passive clients.

   This draft defines two modifications to the main MLS protocol in
   [RFC9420].

   First, it defines expandable paths in Section Section 4 that allow
   retrieving and storing only the minimally required tree information
   to participate in an MLS group.  An expandable tree can always be
   completed to a full MLS tree as described in Section Section 4.6.

   Secondly, it defines receiver specific commits in Section Section 5
   that reduce the data downloaded by clients for processing commits.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  MLS Groups with Passive Clients

   MLS groups with passive clients allow light clients to achieve linear
   computation and communication complexity by using expandable paths
   and receiver specific commits.  In turn, these clients can only
   commit after upgrading to full clients (Section 4.6).

3.1.  Terminology

   This document introduces the following new concepts

   *  Expandable Path: An expandable path is a direct path from a leaf
      node to the root with full nodes along the path, and parent and
      tree hashes on the co-path.

   *  Partial Commit: A partial commit is a commit that the server
      stripped down to hold only the encrypted path secret for the
      receiver.  The framed content signature on partial commits is not
      valid.

   *  Passive client: A passive client is a client that does not know
      the full MLS tree but only its own expandable path.

3.2.  Protocol Changes Overview

   MLS groups that support passive clients must use the passive_clients
   extension (Section 3.3) in the required capabilities.  When this
   extension is present in the group context all messages, except for
   application messages, MUST use public messages.

   The changes are primarily for clients that want to use expandable
   paths.

3.2.1.  Joining a Group with expandable paths

   When joining a group as a client with expandable paths, the client
   downloads only it's own expandable path and the committer's proof of
   membership.  The sender's proof of membership is discarded after
   being checked such that only the client's direct, expandable path is
   stored.

3.2.2.  Processing Proposals

   Proposals are not processed at all.  They are only stored to apply
   when commits use proposals by reference and to know the proposal
   sender.

3.2.3.  Processing Commits

   When processing a commit, the client retrieves

   *  the partial commit that contains only the path secret encrypted
      for the client

   *  the sender's proof of membership

   *  the signed group info

   The client MUST NOT check the signature on the framed content, but
   MUST check the sender's proof of membership, the signed group info,
   and the confirmation tag.

3.2.4.  Changes for committers

   In groups with passive_clients support, committer MUST send a signed
   group info with every commit.

3.2.5.  Server Changes

   The server must track the public group state together with the signed
   group info, and provide endpoints for clients to retrieve expandable
   direct paths, the signed group info, and partial commits.

3.3.  Passive Clients Extension

   The passive_clients group context extension is used to signal that
   the group supports clients with expandable paths.

   enum ExpandableClientType {
     reserved(0),
     no_upgrade(1),
     resync_upgrade(2),
     self_upgrade(3),
     any_upgrade(4),
   }

   struct {
     ExpandableClientType expandable;
   } ExpandablePathsExtension;

   The extension must be present and set in the required capabilities of
   a group when supporting clients with expandable paths.  It further
   defines ways passive clients may upgrade to a full client.

   *  no_upgrade does not allow expandable clients to update to full
      MLS.

   *  resync_upgrade allows clients to upgrade to full MLS by using an
      external commit.  The resync removes the old client from the group
      and adds a new client with full MLS.

   *  self_upgrade allows clients to upgrade to full MLS by retrieving
      the full tree from the server.  Together with the signed group
      info of the current epoch the client "silently" upgrades to full
      MLS with security equivalent to joining a new group.  The client
      MUST perform all checks from Section 12.4.3.1 [RFC9420].

   *  any_upgrade allows clients to use either of the two upgrade
      mechanisms.

   TODO: Add IANA number for the extension.

4.  Expandable Trees

   An expandable tree is a modified ratchet tree as described in
   [RFC9420].  An expandable tree stores only the direct path from the
   member to the root plus additional information about the co-path.

   In particular, a list of Hashes are stored for the member's co-path,
   containing the node's index, it's tree hash as computed on the full
   tree, and the original tree hash as computed on the full tree (recall
   that the original tree hash is the node's tree hash excluding any
   unmerged leaves).

   struct {
     uint32 index;
     opaque tree_hash<V>;
     opaque original_tree_hash<V>;
   } Hashes;

   TODO: Add tree pictures examples for explanation

             R
            /
           P
         __|__
        /     \
       D       S
      / \     / \
    ... ... ... ...
    /
   L

4.1.  Verifying Tree Validity

   A client that has an expandable tree can not do all the checks that a
   client with the full tree can do.  We therefore update the checks
   performed on tree modifications.  In particular the validation of
   commits and welcome packages are modified compared to [RFC9420].

4.1.1.  Joining a Group via Welcome Message

   When a new member joins the group with a Welcome message
   (Section 12.4.3.1.  [RFC9420]) without the ratchet tree extension the
   checks are updated as follows.

   1.  Verify the GroupInfo

       1.  signature

       2.  confirmation tag

       3.  tree hash

   2.  Verify the sender's membership (see Section 4.2).

   3.  Check the own direct path to the root (see Section 4.3).

   4.  Do _not_ verify leaves in the tree.

4.1.2.  Commit

   When a member receives a Commit message (Section 12.4.2.  [RFC9420])
   the checks are updated as follows.

   1.  Verify the sender's membership (see Section 4.2).

   2.  If the own path changed, check it.

4.2.  Proof of Membership

   To verify the group membership of the sender of a commit, the
   receiver with an expandable tree checks the sender's leaf (see
   Section 7.3 [RFC9420]), as well as the correctness of the tree as
   described in Section 4.3.

4.3.  Verifying Expandable Paths

   To verify the correctness of an expandable tree the client checks its
   tree hash and parent hashes.  For each direct path from a leaf to the
   root that the client has, it checks the parent hash value on each
   node by using original_tree_hash of the co-path nodes.  The tree hash
   on the root node is computed similarly, using the tree_hash values
   for all nodes where the client does not have the full nodes.

   Check that the encryption keys of all received nodes are unique.

4.4.  Retrieving Expandable Tree Information

   The ExpandableTree is provided by the delivery service to the client
   on request.  Alternatively, a client can send the ExpandableTree as
   extension in Welcome messages.  See Section 4 for details on the
   expandable tree extension.

4.4.1.  Expandable Tree from the Deliver Service

   In particular, when joining a group, after receiving a Welcome
   message, the client queries the delivery service for the expandable
   tree.  The delivery service must keep track of the group's state
   (tree) and assemble the ExpandableTree when requested for a given
   sender and receiver.

   When receiving a Commit message, the client queries the delivery
   service for the sender's direct path to check its membership.

4.4.2.  Expandable Tree from the Sender

   When the delivery service does not provide the necessary endpoints to
   query the expandable paths, the sender can include it into the
   GroupInfo extensions in the Welcome message.

4.5.  Expandable Tree

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     xnode(1),
     hashes(2),
     (255)
   } XNodeType;

   struct {
     uint32: index;
     optional<Node> node;
   } XNode;

   struct {
     XNodeType node_type;
     select (XNode.node_typ) {
       case xnode:  XNode xnode;
       case hashes: Hashes hashes;
     }
   } ExpandableNode;

   struct {
     ExpandableNode nodes<V>;
     uint32 num_nodes;
   } ExpandableTree;

4.6.  Committing with a Passive Client

   A passive client _can not commit_ because it doesn't know the
   necessary public keys in the tree to encrypt to.  Therefore, if a
   passive client wants to commit, it first has to upgrade to full MLS.
   Because a passive client is not able to fully verify incoming
   proposals, it MUST NOT commit to proposals it received while not
   holding a full tree.  A client that is upgrading to a full MLS tree
   is therefore considered to be a new client that has no knowledge of
   proposals before it joined.  Note that this restriction can not be
   enforced.  However, since each client in [RFC9420] must check the
   proposals, a misbehaving client that upgraded can only successfully
   commit bogus proposals when all other clients and the delivery
   service agree.

   The expandable paths extension (Section 3.3) defines the possible
   upgrade paths for passive clients.

   In order to ensure that the tree retrieved from the server contains
   the expandable path known to the client, the upgrading client MUST
   perform the following checks:

   *  Verify that the tree hash of the expandable path and the full tree
      are equivalent.

   *  Verify that all full nodes (XNode) in the client's state are
      equivalent to the corresponding nodes in the full tree.

   *  Perform all checks on the tree as if joining the group with a
      Welcome message (see Section 12.4.3.1. in [RFC9420]).

   Note that the client already checked the signed

   To retrieve the full tree, the delivery service must provide an end
   point, equivalent to the one used to retrieve the full tree for a new
   member that wants to join with a commit.

4.6.1.  Maintaining state

   After committing, the client can decide to switch to regular MLS and
   process the full tree as described in [RFC9420].  This will cause the
   client's performance to regress to the performance of regular MLS,
   but allows it to commit again without the necessity to download the
   full tree again.

   If the client does not expect to commit regularly, only the
   expandable tree should be kept after a commit.

5.  Receiver specific Commits

   To reduce the size of Commit messages, especially in large, sparse
   trees, the delivery service can strip unnecessary parts of the Commit
   when using the public message type for MLSMessage and the sender type
   is member.

   The structure of the message stays the same but the server removes
   all HPKECiphertext from the encrypted_path_secret in the commit's
   UpdatePath, if present, where the encryption_key does not match the
   receiver's encryption key.

   This breaks the signature on the FramedContent such that this MUST
   NOT be checked by the receiver of such a commit.

   The delivery service sends an expandable commit XCommit message that
   is defined as follows.

   A new content type xcommit(4) is defined for FramedContent.

   struct {
     ExpandableNode nodes<V>;
   } XPath;

   struct {
     ProposalOrRef proposal<V>;
     optional<UpdatePath> path;
     optional<XPath> sender_path;
   } XCommit;

   Similar to checking expandable paths (Section 4.3) the receiver of an
   XCommit MUST verify the parent hash value on each node by using
   original_tree_hash of the co-path nodes, and the tree hash of the new
   tree.

5.1.  Applying receiver specific commits

   When receiving an XCommit, the client applies it like a regular
   commit.

   Additionally, the client checks the membership of the committer as
   described in Section 4.2 using the sender_path.

6.  Active Members

   TODO: changes for active members - send group info message

7.  Deploying Light MLS

   TODO: - describe server changes - deployment considerations

8.  Passive Clients

9.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

   *  public keys only used when committing, at this point we have the
      full tree

   *  own path secrets

   *  proposal validation issues

      -  can't check double join

   *  commits are using only the confirmation tag for the security

      -  group context is not signed -> but it was only used to bind the
         signature to an epoch, which is done by the confirmation tag as
         well

      -  other than that the confirmation tag covers everything relevant
         (except for WireFormat and ProtocolVersion)

      -  proof of membership (Section 4.2) ensures that the sender is in
         the correct subtree

9.1.  Comparison with RFC MLS

   The main change compared to the protocol as specified in [RFC9420] is
   that the receiver of a Welcome or Commit message, with an expandable
   tree, can not perform all checks as mandated in [RFC9420].

   In particular the following checks are omitted.

   *  Check for uniqueness of all encryption and signature keys.
      Because not all keys are known, the check can only be performed on
      the known keys.

   *  Check validity of leaf nodes in the tree when joining a group.

   When using receiver specific commits the following checks are omitted
   in addition.

   *  Check the signature on the FramedContent.

10.  IANA Considerations
